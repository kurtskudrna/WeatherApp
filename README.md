# Weather App
This project is a Weather App that takes any city in the world and can display key information to the user regarding the location's weather.
## Motivation
I felt this project is a niftey tool to be able to get the weather of any city at the click of a button. 
I also found this to be good practice with APIs(https://api.openweathermap.org) in Javascript.
